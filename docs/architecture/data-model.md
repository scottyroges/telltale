# Data Model

## Entity Relationships

```
Question (global prompt catalog)

User
└── Book (grouping container)
    ├── BookQuestion (join: which questions are in this book, optional interviewId link)
    ├── Interview (bookId, topic — the raw conversation)
    │   ├── Message (the back-and-forth)
    │   ├── Insight (extracted metadata for follow-ups)
    │   └── InterviewSummary (rolling summaries, linked list)
    └── Story (bookId, interviewId — polished output)
        └── StorySection (ordered chunks of generated prose)
```

## Key Separations

**Interview vs. Story** — An Interview is the raw conversation between the user and the AI interviewer. A Story is the polished narrative output. One interview can produce multiple stories — a long interview about "childhood" might yield separate stories about school, family, and neighborhood.

**Message vs. Insight** — Messages are the literal back-and-forth. Insights are extracted metadata (named entities, unexplored details, emotional moments) that power follow-up questions within an interview and re-engagement across interviews.

**InterviewSummary (linked list)** — As interviews grow long, rolling summaries keep the AI's context window manageable. Each summary incorporates the previous one plus new messages. The AI uses the latest summary + recent messages instead of replaying the full history.

**Story vs. StorySection** — LLMs can't reliably produce long-form prose in one pass. Stories are generated section by section, then assembled. StorySections provide retry granularity — regenerate one bad section without redoing the whole story.

## Models

### User
Better Auth user model extended with approval and role management. Owns Books.

Fields:
- `approvalStatus` — Controls access to expensive operations (LLM API calls). Values: `PENDING` (default for new signups), `APPROVED` (full access), `REJECTED` (blocked from expensive ops).
- `role` — User role. Values: `USER` (default), `ADMIN` (can approve/reject users via admin panel).

New users default to `PENDING` status. They can sign in and browse content but cannot create interviews or send messages until approved by an admin. The migration backfills existing users to `APPROVED` status.

### Question
Global prompt catalog — hardcoded starting points that kick off interviews. Has a `category` for search and organization (e.g., "childhood", "career", "relationships"). Not user-specific — shared across all users and books.

### Book
Top-level grouping container. A user can have multiple books, each containing a set of interviews and resulting stories. Each book has an optional `coreMemory` — a bounded, evolving text document that the AI interviewer reads and updates each turn, providing persistent memory across all interviews in the book. Status lifecycle: `IN_PROGRESS` → `COMPLETE` → `ARCHIVED`.

### BookQuestion
Join table tracking which catalog questions a user has selected for a given book. Provides a curated list of suggested topics. An optional `interviewId` FK links to the interview started from this question — its presence indicates the question has been explored. Unique constraint on `(bookId, questionId)`.

### Interview
The raw conversation container. Owns its `topic` as a plain text field — the prompt used to start the conversation, whether it came from the catalog or custom user input. Contains all messages, extracted insights, and rolling summaries. Interview has no dependency on the Question model; BookQuestion optionally links back to it. Status lifecycle: `ACTIVE` → `PAUSED` → `COMPLETE`.

### Message
Individual message in an interview. Has a `role` (USER, ASSISTANT, SYSTEM). A `hidden` flag (default `false`) allows messages to participate in the LLM's context window without appearing in the user-visible transcript — used for backend-injected steering prompts. Messages are append-only and immutable — no `updatedAt`.

### Insight
Extracted metadata from interview conversations. Types:
- **ENTITY** — person, place, thing (e.g., "sister Maria", "farm in Calabria")
- **EVENT** — something that happened
- **EMOTION** — emotional moment worth revisiting
- **DETAIL** — unexplored detail mentioned but not elaborated on

Tracks whether the insight has been `explored` in follow-up questions. Interview-scoped but queried across all interviews in a book for cross-interview follow-ups.

### InterviewSummary
Rolling summaries forming a linked list via `parentSummaryId`. Each summary incorporates the previous summary plus new messages. `messageCount` tracks cumulative messages covered. Append-only — no `updatedAt`.

### Story
Polished narrative output from an interview. Has a direct relationship to both Book (for ordering) and Interview (for provenance). `prose` holds the final assembled text from sections. `orderIndex` controls position in the book. Status lifecycle: `DRAFT` → `REVIEWED` → `FINAL`.

### StorySection
Ordered chunks of generated prose within a story. Each section is generated independently, allowing retry of individual sections. `orderIndex` controls assembly order. Status lifecycle: `GENERATING` → `DRAFT` → `FINAL`.

## Schema Conventions

- **Application model IDs** use `@default(cuid())` in the Prisma schema, but since the Prisma client is not used at runtime, repositories generate IDs via `@paralleldrive/cuid2`. Better Auth models use plain `String @id` with runtime-generated IDs.
- **Table names** use `@@map("snake_case")` for all models
- **Foreign keys** have `@@index` for query performance and `onDelete: Cascade` on parent relations
- **InterviewSummary.parentSummaryId** has `@unique` to enforce a strict 1:1 linked list (each summary can be the parent of at most one child)
- **Message** and **InterviewSummary** have no `updatedAt` — they are append-only/immutable

## Query Layer

Schema and migrations are managed by Prisma (`schema.prisma` + `prisma migrate`). All repository queries are written in Kysely, a type-safe SQL query builder that gives full control over the generated SQL. Kysely database types are auto-generated from the Prisma schema via `prisma-kysely`. See ADR 015 for the full rationale.

## Auth Models

Account, Session, and Verification models follow the standard Better Auth schema. These models are managed by Better Auth — IDs are generated at runtime (no `@default(cuid())`), and table names are lowercased via `@@map`.
